# MMPI2

An implementation of the MMPI-2 (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory rev. 2). Its question set was taken from work released under the GNU GPL 3 by Kevin Timmerman in 2008.

Added zh_cn.

This is just a high school student's translation, I can't guarantee it is proper. But I believe it's at least better than the [apesk.com](https://apesk.com/mmpi)'s translation(a widely spread version).

一个 MMPI-2 的 JavaScript 实现，在原有的英文问题集基础上添加了简体中文翻译。
